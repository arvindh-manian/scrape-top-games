# scrape-top-games
Scrapes the top games from each year at https://metacritic.com and displays them in a TKinter GUI

## Why?
Mostly for me to get experience with BS4 and multithreading, but I thought someone might also find the data sets useful.

## How do I use this?
Usage is pretty simple.
First, install python if you haven't already.
Second, navigate to the directory where you downloaded this repo (using cd) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After that, you can run this script at any point in the future by running `python (or python3 depending on your platform) game_scraper.py [start year] [end year]`

Note: Start and End year are both inclusive.

Utilize the Tkinter GUI by running `python gui.py`
