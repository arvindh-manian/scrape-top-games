Originally released in Japanese arcades in the Fall of 2008, the original Tatsunoko vs. Capcom moved to the Wii console on December 11, 2008.

It\u2019s a battler oyale that delivers match-ups that only exist in fans wildest dreams!

The Assist feature adds another compelling element found Capcom\u2019s other VS series: allowing players to switch their character on the fly or call for help from their tag-team partner, allowing for spectacular super moves (Hyper Variable Combination). Successful execution of the Assist feature can turn the tide of battle on a dime.

More moves include the offensive Assault and defensive maneuver Mega Crash. Another new gameplay mechanic, titled Baroque, illuminates the character in a rainbow of colors, cancels the current attack and extends combos and damage. Featuring a robust line-up of characters, the console version added four mini-games and optional control schemes. [Capcom]",
